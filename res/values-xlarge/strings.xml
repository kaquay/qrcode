    <string name="about"><Data><![CDATA[<font size="12">44Doors began whit the idea of bringing people togetehr through simple, meaningful interactions. Our software and strategies focus on reducing the friction often associated with communities and conversations. We strive for simple, yet powerful, interactions, and look to improve relationships throught active engagement. <br> We believe all conversations have value. Organizations must monetize these interactions to measure their impact, not simply for dashboards, stock tickes, and board meetings, but to ensure their value as an entity. This value is the commitment madeto employees, share holders, constituents, donors, partners, and the comunity. <br> Our name, 44Doors, stems from the main door of an organization, Decades ago, each business had a single, main entrance. Every interaction flowed throught that simple doorway. It was less complicated and easier to meansure. Today, organizations have many "doors" in which they operate, both physical and digital. Between buildings, catalogs, call centers, Twitter, Facebook, kiosks, direct mail. </font>]]></Data></string>
